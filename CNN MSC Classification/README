Neural Network for Cell Classification

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a class of stem cells capable of differentiating into bone, cartilage, and fat cells.  The goal of this project was to train a neural network to classify MSCs as being highly proliferative or low.  The images of the cells are available upon request.
A presentation is provided to give background on this topic and show the results.
The code is an example of the script used to train the neural network to classify the images.
