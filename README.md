## Neural Network for Cell Classification
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a class of stem cells capable of differentiating into bone, cartilage, and fat cells.  The goal of this project was to train a neural network to classify MSCs as being highly proliferative or low.  Samples of images of the cells are available upon request.
## Bacteria Identification
Mass spectometry can be used to identify cells, and this project's goal was to determine with a random forest classifier one of the types of bacteria present in a mixture of two types.
## Stock Market Prediction
Ten years of national and international news was collected via a NY Times API, and natual language processing was performed to try predict the daily movement of the S&P 500.
## Crime
This project is based on the Communities and Crime Data Set. This dataset, available at the
UCI Machine Learning Repository, was produced from combining the following:
* Socio-economic data from the 1990 US Census
* Law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey
* Crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR
The goals of this project are to construct models that can predict the per capita violent crime
rate for each community, and to determine the strongest and weakest attributes among the 122
attributes thought to have a plausible connection to crime that are selected from a wider set of
attributes
