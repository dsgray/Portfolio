## Neural Network for Cell Classification
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a class of stem cells capable of differentiating into bone, cartilage, and fat cells.  The goal of this project was to train a neural network to classify MSCs as being highly proliferative or low.  The images of the cells are available upon request.
## Bacteria Identification
Mass spectometry can be used to identify cells, and this project's goal was to determine with a random forest classifier one of the types of bacteria present in a mixture of two types.
